Event Delegation is mechanism via which we can attach a event listener of a specific element to its parent element.
In this way, when a event is trigger by the child element, that can be bubbled up to the parent level for which the event listener is added.
So, using Event Delegation we can write a generic code which can executed across multiple child elements.

When coming to a single page application, the content of the page is dynamically updated depending on various requests.
If a event listener is written directly on the child element, then for newly/dynamically added elements there will be no listeners.
But by using Event Delegation, as the listener is attached to the parent element, even for the dynamically added the same listener will be reflected.
